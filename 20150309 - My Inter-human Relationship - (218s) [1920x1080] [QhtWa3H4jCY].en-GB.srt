00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
About two and half years ago, I wanted someone to help with the art side of my

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,259
webcomic because I had no idea where to start.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,969
I started looking at other people's art in my school until I saw one girl's

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,070
drawings and I was absolutely ~amazed~

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,110
(SHE'S THE ONEEEEEEEE)

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,880
I basically told her: you're my friend now!

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,250
She probably didn't realise what she was getting herself into.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
We're still friends to this day, but still, I am an annoying friend.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,689
Seriously, this one time at lunch, I randomly asked her

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,400
"Will you say fo' shizzle?"

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,540
*because she's bllaaaaaaaaaaaccckkkk*

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,380
and said "no" *aww*

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,070
"What if I get a hundred people to sign a petition?"

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,620
"Okay." She said, thinking I wouldn't spend the rest of lunch going to random tables

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,829
having then sign a piece of paper and then having everyone in my English and

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,110
drama class sign it.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,470
I got a hundred signatures in one day *get on meh level.* and she, being true to

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,190
her word, said it and I taped it too. I asked her if I could show the video and she

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,390
said no.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,200
"What if I get a hundred people to sig-" "NO." so sorry guys,

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,560
here's the audio.

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,340
And I'm also friends with this ginger kid and to protect his identity, we'll call

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,080
him Nick Jiggly.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,590
That was a nickname I gave him because his real name was Nick Jernigan and

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,970
what really sparked our friendship was out love for dating woman *james is a player*. I'm just

26
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,680
kidding, we played 'Magic: The Gathering' and we was (slightly) better than me but

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,369
only because he bought the most expensive cards so whenever he would be

28
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,299
beating me,

29
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,299
I would get back at him emotionally by insulting his red hair.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,830
"I attack with my Reaper from the abyss-" SAYS THE GINGER! >:(

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,620
he would always laugh about it (but I secretly meant it).

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,640
So this one time, my boy scout troop took a trip

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,459
to a lake and there was one spot where you go cliff diving and I wasn't on the

34
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,780
young side anymore.

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,709
I was more in the middle. And everyone was having a fun time,

36
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,010
swimming and jumping and this one kid named Harris.

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,040
(he was one of the young ones) he came up to us and said "My mum told me I can't go

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
cliff diving" and in my mind, I was thinking

39
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,760
"Mksay harris, YOUR MUM'S NOT HERE." But I didn't really care too much. A couple

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,500
hours passed and everyone just started talking on top of the cliff and I spot

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,100
Harris sitting by himself and I get an idea. >:)

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,120
I said "Hey Harris, why don't you come sit with us?"

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,400
(I hope you know where I'm going with this) Harris joined the group,

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,430
still it's quiet though and I wanted to push him off the cliff.

45
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,070
I started to think of ways I can get him close to the edge, but the dude was

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:06,340
already standing near the edge back turned probably being of something emotional.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,990
Tell me if you were in my position, you wouldn't push him off the edge and I

48
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,620
scream,

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,710
"YOUR MUM'S NOT HERE!" as I push him off.

50
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,350
He was fiiiiineee, I jumped off there plenty of times, we should have seen his face,

51
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,500
he flailed his arms a lot but was dead silent.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,209
He probably thought her was going to die. Hey Harris was a quiet kid, he didn't

53
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,320
have any friends either.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,530
So after I pushed him, people talked to him for like five minutes.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,700
So Harris, if you're watching this, you're welcome :D
